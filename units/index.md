# Ada Developers Academy Jump Start

This repository contains the materials presented during the [Ada Developers Academy](adadevelopersacademy.org) jump start program. This program is intended for anyone who is interested in jump-starting their journey into coding. These materials and concepts will provide an introduction into programming tools, concepts and processes to assist in getting to the first step in your programming journey.

## Learning Goals

### Learning Style 
Whether you have gone through a traditional post-secondary program recently or not, gearing up to learn new skills can be an adjustment for many folks. It is good to get a gauge on your learning style as soon as possible to be able to jump right in and absorb the material in a way that works well for you.

### Problem Solving 
Breaking down complex problems is a fundamental skill as a software engineer. While we will be doing this for years to come, we want to give you an opportunity to explore problem solving in programatic ways and exploring topics like:

- input
- output
- algorithms
- variable substitution

### Workflow
Learning to become a programmer requires that you use your computer in the most efficient way possible. This allows you to free up your mental resource so you can focus on the difficult problems rather than navigating your computer.

### Exposure to Programming
We think that getting a good start with fundamental programming concepts can help you discover what you love about programming. The list of skills that we consider in this fundamental group include:

- variables
- data structures
- substitution
- patterns
